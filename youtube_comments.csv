Listen my caribbean people who think you all know 'Proper English' and hinting that Guyanese are backward. Chicken Curry is 'we' thing that makes us unique for all you 'sensible' people. So yall just stop yall nonsense and check every year which set of students excel the best at CXC....  the same backward Guyanese. We proud of our backwardness.
The proper name is chicken curry not curry chicken what is it called in the original country it was invented in ? Yea the most viewed video on this dish with over 66 million views is called chicken curry 🤣👌🏽

Excellent job!
Bess!!
They killed it! 🔥
Love this mix! ❤
When I hear this song I miss Tobago
This is a classic
This sound has real vibes
"THE MEETING PLACE — a metaphorical way of saying, here we musically present the best of two worlds, which are in some ways different, but yet one.

What a gem of a song — as two greats in African and Caribbean music join forces with the steel band, Siparia Deltones. Hugh Masekela with his distinctive voice and his seductive wind instrument; Machel Montano with his hypnotic voice and cadence; and Siparia Deltones with the pulsating allure of the steelpan, expertly played.

Enjoy this here then go download it properly.
Let's support our artistes by buying their music, so they can produce more and inspire and mentor new younger artistes.

Like yourself
"Machel was Inducted as the Soca Ambassador and was given the Calypso Torch, by Sparrow,Kitchener, Calypso Rose, Mighty Duke, Arrow, Swallow all of whom raised and nutured Machel in the Calypso Arena. Not to mention Machel is a natural Singer and Performer whose standard is parallel to none. ""We saw that when he performed ah too young to Soca at the Queen's Park Savannah when he took the title of the Junior Calypso Monarch and he never looked back. He just took off like a rocket as we expected him too. Credit must go to his Parents for raising him and his brother Marcus who is a Captain(Pilot) at Caribbean Airlines. Love and respect to the Montano Family, and keep the flag flying."

Dance your stress and bad vibes away! The power of music.
I struggle with social anxieties and public speaking but have to do it. I always play this song right before going around people or public speaking and they NEVER believe me when I tell them I have social anxieties. 😅 This song gives me so much confidence. And yes! I dance too 💃🏾 😂❤ #DanceTheStressAway #DanceBadVibesAway
Haitians or Trinidadians here we go ayayayyy 🇭🇹❤❤  🇹🇹
"Amazing Fusion. I love Konpa and dance to it all the time.  I was born and still live in London but have lived abroad and travelled elsewhere.  I love this fusion of Soca, Konpa and Zouk.  The track is a collaboration between Machel (Trini artist) and Problem Child (from St. Vincent & the Grenadines - where my parents are from)  I went to Notting Hill Carnival this year and it was nice.  Met people from all over the Caribbean (hello Curacao crew from the Netherlands).  I love Caribbean culture.   There is so much to be proud of.  Please continue to generate good vibes, culture, revenues, skills, expertise and of course the excellent music.  Half of St Vincent still has it's French town names and we still have indigenous Carib people in the north, much like our Dominican cousins (who also have a Carib settlement - but there's is well preserved and we are trying to hang on to ours).  Big up everyone from the Caribbean (and not just in the islandsthe .  We are spread far and wide to include all of the not so obvious places like Belize, Colombian coastline towns, the French, Dutch and English Guianas (Guyana) and the like.  We are definitely one people...The African Diaspora is extensive, talented, beautiful and so inclusive/ friendly.  Love from London to de world...."
Kompa and Bouyon  music give soca a different vibe.
As a guadeloupean woman I approve it badlyyyyy! Ouiiiiiii💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾 Machel will always surprise me! Definitely the King of soca💕

"Allyuh when this covid done is pure bacchanal for Trini carnival, no holding back. it's going to be ah fete on the road like you never seen before. Like losing your carnival virginity all over again. LOL"
This song always reminds me of unfair COVID restrictions imposed by far-left governments. Florida will always stand for freedom.
This song gives me goosebumps ❤
Maybe next time include different ethnicity is your videos that would be nice.Think TRINIDAD STILL COLOR CODED
Endless Epic tunes!! King of Socca! ❤️💯🎉🎉

Yuh don't have too ask for anymore
💃💃💃💃💃
Avisti ce sona cuistu
Still got the vibes
"this  guy is talented, but he needs to upgrade his swag.every year he sings about ass shaking, grinding on some woman, he needs a national positive message for the youths. sometimes, its not always about him and his name brand. Due to the fact that your name is big in Trinidad doesn't mean that you can sing anything and Trinidad will stay silent. David Rudder is a positive, inspiring ,intellectual singer, along with a lot of others. Am not hating on him. Infact, i like some of his songs, but he needs to use his platform on a broader base . leave those childish lyrics for the younger singers, you're too old for the roll."
Niceness!
the girls with the convaunt acsaunt I cant take!!!!!!!! but this song
the shot with the family in jammies dancing on the sofa!!!!!!!! love it
Every once in a while I come to this track when the reality of this thing hits me and I get in a funk! Music really has healing abilities and each dose of this one really picks me up! Thanks Machel! This is why we call you the King of Soca!❤️

"Dear machel, I'm writing to inform you that Jesus isn't happy with the lifestyle you're leading. Jesus has asked me to warn you to quit this immoral road that can only lead you to hell, and return to him. You already know what to do. You may be the biggest star in Trinidad, but in hell that star can't shine. In heaven you will shine even brighter. Give and dedicate your last few days on earth to Jesus and save your soul, for what shall it profit you to gain the world and lose your soul in hell? Tomorrow may be too late dear machel, tomorrow may be too late, tomorrow may be too late."

Biafra (mostly populated by Igbos) is needing your voice as we fight for our freedom from the British contraption called Nigeria.

Big tune

"You said-teach them to fish- so I just told my Big Fish tales, it’s the voices in my head. You said “Gsl’s Gonna Lead” if I talk too much I’m sorry it’s just mad adlibs… they say fake it till you make it."
"I don’t want to spend another moment apart. It’s a new week, it gets harder every day z& doesn’t seem fair to us."
It’s only time- this morning I just want to keep “behaving in your loving o& get baptized” thank you for wrapping everything up in love. You gift wrap love 😍🥰😘

"I’ll eat my Dubplate alone, got me downtown Oakland skits out … WTF is wrong with me!!!"
EEN? He did this shit all the time “if I ever get the nerve to say hello I. This caffe’”
"You got in bed with Kal & budfuko, some mob shit"
The mater of tickets said 5 x “tose seats are no longer available” every time I put them in the cart. I blame it on the same reason you never “mentioned”me <>
"You know I came. I’m not going in the parking. I’m not planning tricks on my mind, I’ll look for concert footage. My bone cancer is numbing my arm. I deserve respet, not cortisone stress."
"He doesn’t care about the “charts” he cares about where Dolly Music puts him, deep inside me everywhere ❤❤❤❤❤ & that’s hod Daddy “gift wraps love”"
My daddy makes Dolly music for me & tells me “you can call me daddy” in his 2Pac voice 🏠💦💘🥄
THEY would all  haha hysterically at you!! Why the “”  do you put me through this!!!! That’s WHY because you’re proud to take all those pictures with your maroon heritage?? And wouldn’t that just bring the most shame ????? you’re a shamed of me!!! just be real with yourself because I know!!!
"He kept cat& retro see me all why I was in Kingston. He never believes a word I say about you, he’s just patent with me. Calm Down is our song. He is who Jah put in my life. He called & supported me & I kept pushing him away for what? Because your a better catch? He’s just fine, get off my line please big fish go fk up other white women’s life with your SHAME. because that’s all it boils down to is your shame.!!!!’"
Do you have any idea how good it felt when Kimani picks me up with his scronny self. He looked so excited in his eyes just to have one day after I fked up my whole vacation chasing YOU. Shame on me for treating my man like that & thirsting over a celebrity.
You’re the devil’s in the deep blues sea. Stay away from me!!!
"The pain you leave me in it’s just a fire ‘ my eyes can’t take one more of your fkn tears!!!! You got me. If R wants to jump in this fire & salvage anything that looks like a human you just FK OFF and let him
 Do it!!!!!!!"
I am called to worship at your feet it’s my whole hearts desires I told you my tender most intimate feelings because your my husband. Our love is classic. We know what it means there is no place you can’t go and nothing you can’t do
"We’ve been married since our anniversary in 2017. I sent you a card it said “for my husband” I told you I couldn’t find another one & I couldn’t find a husband either. Since you didn’t say no, I just assumed…"
If it’s Sweeter tonight tell me about Hosanna. Can you hear me shout it out to you?
This song is giving me the strength to endure the struggle.

This is so real ...i was born to cure men because James Brown (one of my dads) could only cure women.. instead ive been used to heighten illnesses and make meds to create depenancy. I was one  the first to get covid because i got coronavirus and went to  hospital and they used my blood heighten it. They're gonna do the same if i catch this new infection that attaches to syphilis. They're (the medical industry) is going to use me to kill ppl. I was born for greatness.... not this shiiii

Iah is the most high 😢
"👌 #buju banton 🙏, what a song 💯"
I should start asking for mercy. I never pray for mercy.
"Buju: I want you to know who Yah bless, no man curse. He puts us through the thorns of life as a warning because He thinks highly of us & wants us not to end up in thorns for eternity. Return to Him & He will return to you,Son.❤"
In defense of my life make haste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

"Meanwhile, in the real world, you’re enjoying Trish’s new sock collection make sure to give Gramps and his wife some for Christmas and all of their children as well. Maybe you can put a onesie in the stocking stuffer for Trisha‘s new son BORN FOR GREATNESS."
"Airstrikes all day that nobody can talk about my pain is frivolous. I own two pieces of property in California.. none of this is real. I wrote you a beautiful song today called Earth, Angel, which you will never see because well it’s on Facebook."
You said don’t worry about a thing Dolly daddy’s coming
K nighty night Sweet love. Thanks for spending quality time with me
Hahaha 🤰 daddy always delivers because he’s the doctor in dollyville
Every dolly needs a da da daddy to love 🎂💘💦🤰
I only sing show tune to make you horney it doesn’t pay the bills lol
Oh nooo Daddy’s gonna broooke of my back again 😊 I wanna be your love slave ❤
So Jah say never waste your seed so I’m your fairy godmother in my garden you till the soil & plant the seeds with your tool so sharpen . Its our holy union <>
The side you show me is different than anything I’ve ever seen. The only time I seen the side I know is when you said I was your lover’s choice.
"We’ve been married 7 years. I just sent you a card like I did every year, but this year it said “for my husband” your god so I just assumed you accepted me."
"Dolly is so so sweet & Dolly says daddy stay right here, but I can’t breathe all night with the golden spoon 🥄 in my mouth 👄 daddy just gives me the pillow & she requests his big bottom grip wich dolly shouldn’t do…"
There are so many inundate things I want to tell you when I’m 1/2 asleep & I want to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. I want to be the juicy unicorn again
Writing R into that Sabrina Carpenter song I didn’t do that source did that. Because source makes me the baddest genius ever.!!! there was dictating about how life is just a dream from disco lemonade and the lyric is and I had too much caffeine -R says-says I don’t drink coffee because it’s just not right for me -and then source has me hearing Sabrina say but what about the espresso that has nothing to do with me that source that’s the voices in my head that schizophrenia .
"I get migraines because I’m tapping from source. Sources is writing source wants something done. You can call it JAH!! I call it source. Source is not something that I can call father, it’s something I can harness.."
Listening to the radio was comical they are serious about how bad their  barz are. That’s why I’m so facetious? I cant listen long I get a migraine. Your sound solos me like a cat. I’m so in love with the way your voice makes me feel. Your words live in my body & I my head
When is Daddy coming for me?
"Here comes the rain again, falling on my heart like an open breeze, you wonder why I say loving you is like a disease I called the Buju flu… and you say, baby girl it’s all about you… I’d say it’s you but you know I’m lying…. You come back to let me know that you have a thing for me? But never let it show in the public eye you were given someone else to try."
"Then there it is that rain falling from my eyes, no matter how many times I tell myself big girls don’t cry, because mommy’s not there to dry your eye & mine never did anyways, she just let them dry."
"Oh I can’t stand the rain, like I can’t stand the pain so i ran away to Waterhouse & the port of Spain 🇪🇸 you were there, so that’s why, I can’t stand the rain …."

Big tune Thank you
It’s all I can think about & I look for you everywhere
"& when I look at your social media who do I see? What are you always in, can’t ever look there again"
Your music is my sound refuge & I need it
Seeing any footage of you since 2019 gives me PTSD like I don’t know who you are. I feel like I’m loosing the you I know & my mind hurts
I want to spend quality time 😢where is daddy !! Where are you! You never talk & I get too manic over music as we can see….
I’m just so fluffy & soft @ can’t stop caughing. But it’s my bred they just ache
You’re just a phenomenon I have with music and that’s all a real man talks
"So you can’t bring back the pain of yesterday, but you could’ve prevented the pain of last night and my arm ached because I have bone cancer that’s undiagnosed"
Good morning. I’m ignoring the real world & living in mine I don’t want to see anything about where your going or doing because it’s crumbling my reality 😢
Goodnight handsome kissy kissy get tucked in sweet dreams
Oh noooo . Not dollys poor back don’t brake it …..
I’m just so big like a fluffy cupcake I can’t sit down anywhere ☹️ after the twins. And now you got me again 😢😊😅
Please Daddy.. fluff up my pillow for my head
Please
"It’s all about just doing crazy zellest things for love. That’s always The Mission. I heard it in a love song, can’t be wrong, (Brandy you’re soooooo crazy, I know) that’s why Martin Scorsese is the executive producer… I just assumed Pit knows him, he says he does, greeezzz…. #Krazy"
Where is your radio promotion? Your 3 hit set? You have R&B songs
"It’s about your elevation & your ability, your lifetime making friends in your profession. And how you can make it I. Mainstream because the era is finally ready for you. This Is Jamaica 🇯🇲 is very very catchy. Should be on the radio, airtime is bought."
"Ben/ I shall call him Benjamin Franklin from now on. You & I are like this fable: a man & woman who love themselves so much they each sell something important to give the other a lavish gift, but the thing they sold was what the other’s gift was for. In essence “we are hurting only each other trying to make the other one happy”"
"It’s always like the great & powerful OZ … it’s been there since I was @an itty bitty pretty one” just watching me grow. When I smash it, music says why? Why don’t you just let me sparkle?"
Ben- haha he IS I ❤ Radio. He IS the sphere in LV. He’s “ultramegriffic” I could bore WILL I AM with the details.. but he’d just say like buggzzz “that’s very very interesting”….. it’s just music like Pac say <>

Biafra (mostly populated by Igbos) is needing your voice as we fight for our freedom from the British contraption called Nigeria.

"I don’t want to spend another moment apart. It’s a new week, it gets harder every day z& doesn’t seem fair to us."
It’s only time- this morning I just want to keep “behaving in your loving o& get baptized” thank you for wrapping everything up in love. You gift wrap love 😍🥰😘

"I’ll eat my Dubplate alone, got me downtown Oakland skits out … WTF is wrong with me!!!"
EEN? He did this shit all the time “if I ever get the nerve to say hello I. This caffe’”
"You got in bed with Kal & budfuko, some mob shit"
The mater of tickets said 5 x “tose seats are no longer available” every time I put them in the cart. I blame it on the same reason you never “mentioned”me <>
"You know I came. I’m not going in the parking. I’m not planning tricks on my mind, I’ll look for concert footage. My bone cancer is numbing my arm. I deserve respet, not cortisone stress."
"He doesn’t care about the “charts” he cares about where Dolly Music puts him, deep inside me everywhere ❤❤❤❤❤ & that’s hod Daddy “gift wraps love”"
My daddy makes Dolly music for me & tells me “you can call me daddy” in his 2Pac voice 🏠💦💘🥄
THEY would all  haha hysterically at you!! Why the “”  do you put me through this!!!! That’s WHY because you’re proud to take all those pictures with your maroon heritage?? And wouldn’t that just bring the most shame ????? you’re a shamed of me!!! just be real with yourself because I know!!!
"He kept cat& retro see me all why I was in Kingston. He never believes a word I say about you, he’s just patent with me. Calm Down is our song. He is who Jah put in my life. He called & supported me & I kept pushing him away for what? Because your a better catch? He’s just fine, get off my line please big fish go fk up other white women’s life with your SHAME. because that’s all it boils down to is your shame.!!!!’"
Do you have any idea how good it felt when Kimani picks me up with his scronny self. He looked so excited in his eyes just to have one day after I fked up my whole vacation chasing YOU. Shame on me for treating my man like that & thirsting over a celebrity.
You’re the devil’s in the deep blues sea. Stay away from me!!!
"The pain you leave me in it’s just a fire ‘ my eyes can’t take one more of your fkn tears!!!! You got me. If R wants to jump in this fire & salvage anything that looks like a human you just FK OFF and let him
 Do it!!!!!!!"
I am called to worship at your feet it’s my whole hearts desires I told you my tender most intimate feelings because your my husband. Our love is classic. We know what it means there is no place you can’t go and nothing you can’t do
"We’ve been married since our anniversary in 2017. I sent you a card it said “for my husband” I told you I couldn’t find another one & I couldn’t find a husband either. Since you didn’t say no, I just assumed…"
If it’s Sweeter tonight tell me about Hosanna. Can you hear me shout it out to you?

This is so real ...i was born to cure men because James Brown (one of my dads) could only cure women.. instead ive been used to heighten illnesses and make meds to create depenancy. I was one  the first to get covid because i got coronavirus and went to  hospital and they used my blood heighten it. They're gonna do the same if i catch this new infection that attaches to syphilis. They're (the medical industry) is going to use me to kill ppl. I was born for greatness.... not this shiiii

Iah is the most high 😢
"👌 #buju banton 🙏, what a song 💯"
I should start asking for mercy. I never pray for mercy.
"Buju: I want you to know who Yah bless, no man curse. He puts us through the thorns of life as a warning because He thinks highly of us & wants us not to end up in thorns for eternity. Return to Him & He will return to you,Son.❤"
In defense of my life make haste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

"Meanwhile, in the real world, you’re enjoying Trish’s new sock collection make sure to give Gramps and his wife some for Christmas and all of their children as well. Maybe you can put a onesie in the stocking stuffer for Trisha‘s new son BORN FOR GREATNESS."
"Airstrikes all day that nobody can talk about my pain is frivolous. I own two pieces of property in California.. none of this is real. I wrote you a beautiful song today called Earth, Angel, which you will never see because well it’s on Facebook."
You said don’t worry about a thing Dolly daddy’s coming
K nighty night Sweet love. Thanks for spending quality time with me
Hahaha 🤰 daddy always delivers because he’s the doctor in dollyville
Every dolly needs a da da daddy to love 🎂💘💦🤰
I only sing show tune to make you horney it doesn’t pay the bills lol
Oh nooo Daddy’s gonna broooke of my back again 😊 I wanna be your love slave ❤
So Jah say never waste your seed so I’m your fairy godmother in my garden you till the soil & plant the seeds with your tool so sharpen . Its our holy union <>
The side you show me is different than anything I’ve ever seen. The only time I seen the side I know is when you said I was your lover’s choice.
"We’ve been married 7 years. I just sent you a card like I did every year, but this year it said “for my husband” your god so I just assumed you accepted me."
"Dolly is so so sweet & Dolly says daddy stay right here, but I can’t breathe all night with the golden spoon 🥄 in my mouth 👄 daddy just gives me the pillow & she requests his big bottom grip wich dolly shouldn’t do…"
There are so many inundate things I want to tell you when I’m 1/2 asleep & I want to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. I want to be the juicy unicorn again
Writing R into that Sabrina Carpenter song I didn’t do that source did that. Because source makes me the baddest genius ever.!!! there was dictating about how life is just a dream from disco lemonade and the lyric is and I had too much caffeine -R says-says I don’t drink coffee because it’s just not right for me -and then source has me hearing Sabrina say but what about the espresso that has nothing to do with me that source that’s the voices in my head that schizophrenia .
"I get migraines because I’m tapping from source. Sources is writing source wants something done. You can call it JAH!! I call it source. Source is not something that I can call father, it’s something I can harness.."
Listening to the radio was comical they are serious about how bad their  barz are. That’s why I’m so facetious? I cant listen long I get a migraine. Your sound solos me like a cat. I’m so in love with the way your voice makes me feel. Your words live in my body & I my head
When is Daddy coming for me?
"Here comes the rain again, falling on my heart like an open breeze, you wonder why I say loving you is like a disease I called the Buju flu… and you say, baby girl it’s all about you… I’d say it’s you but you know I’m lying…. You come back to let me know that you have a thing for me? But never let it show in the public eye you were given someone else to try."
"Then there it is that rain falling from my eyes, no matter how many times I tell myself big girls don’t cry, because mommy’s not there to dry your eye & mine never did anyways, she just let them dry."
"Oh I can’t stand the rain, like I can’t stand the pain so i ran away to Waterhouse & the port of Spain 🇪🇸 you were there, so that’s why, I can’t stand the rain …."
😂😂😂mih name call here 😂😂😂

Big tune Thank you
It’s all I can think about & I look for you everywhere
"& when I look at your social media who do I see? What are you always in, can’t ever look there again"
Your music is my sound refuge & I need it
Seeing any footage of you since 2019 gives me PTSD like I don’t know who you are. I feel like I’m loosing the you I know & my mind hurts
I want to spend quality time 😢where is daddy !! Where are you! You never talk & I get too manic over music as we can see….
I’m just so fluffy & soft @ can’t stop caughing. But it’s my bred they just ache
You’re just a phenomenon I have with music and that’s all a real man talks
"So you can’t bring back the pain of yesterday, but you could’ve prevented the pain of last night and my arm ached because I have bone cancer that’s undiagnosed"
Good morning. I’m ignoring the real world & living in mine I don’t want to see anything about where your going or doing because it’s crumbling my reality 😢
Goodnight handsome kissy kissy get tucked in sweet dreams
Oh noooo . Not dollys poor back don’t brake it …..
I’m just so big like a fluffy cupcake I can’t sit down anywhere ☹️ after the twins. And now you got me again 😢😊😅
Please Daddy.. fluff up my pillow for my head
Please
"It’s all about just doing crazy zellest things for love. That’s always The Mission. I heard it in a love song, can’t be wrong, (Brandy you’re soooooo crazy, I know) that’s why Martin Scorsese is the executive producer… I just assumed Pit knows him, he says he does, greeezzz…. #Krazy"
Where is your radio promotion? Your 3 hit set? You have R&B songs
"It’s about your elevation & your ability, your lifetime making friends in your profession. And how you can make it I. Mainstream because the era is finally ready for you. This Is Jamaica 🇯🇲 is very very catchy. Should be on the radio, airtime is bought."
"Ben/ I shall call him Benjamin Franklin from now on. You & I are like this fable: a man & woman who love themselves so much they each sell something important to give the other a lavish gift, but the thing they sold was what the other’s gift was for. In essence “we are hurting only each other trying to make the other one happy”"
"It’s always like the great & powerful OZ … it’s been there since I was @an itty bitty pretty one” just watching me grow. When I smash it, music says why? Why don’t you just let me sparkle?"
Ben- haha he IS I ❤ Radio. He IS the sphere in LV. He’s “ultramegriffic” I could bore WILL I AM with the details.. but he’d just say like buggzzz “that’s very very interesting”….. it’s just music like Pac say <>

6:57 and also at the same time he’s bragging about doing the same thing he’s condemning
Wait .. it have men in Trinidad behaving this way?? 😂😂😂
"I do not agree with the drizzle drizzle movement but I understand.  if you do not, that just means you have not dated in the USA lately, women have always been spoiled and entitled however, it is 1000 times worth, again.  I think this is some silly behavior for making a video, however it has always been the norm that whomever invites pays!!!!"
"I pay for my shit, you pay for yours, we both working and i don't want your money nor your p-ssy, but if you throw it on me and you're my type i deffinately not refusing. Just doh feel i have to pay for everything. We both work so we both pay, doh play games, my money don't play that shit. It pays for my shit."
Bro. The way you think has gotten the dating market the way it is today. Lmao. They can’t wait to come across men like you. They love to take advantage of men who are lost in the sauce. Enjoy
Reel Dotishness. Men for millennia are the providers. Story Close.
DrizzleDrizzle is here to stay! It's not an American theme... It's KingThang!! #Pay2Play #Realmendon'tsimp #KingWorld!
Drizzle drizzle 😅
Drizzle drizzle
"I saw no fault in Sheldon. The lady asked him out and then asked, "" Are you (Sheldon) going to pay for the bill (including hers)?"". If Sheldon is who asked her out then fine, he should cover the bill. Why I understand prior communication should have been had but this would have resulted in her not bothering to go out if he had said 50/50 or something. The audacity to ask a man out and still expects him to pay for both beyond me. As Sheldon said, he has financial obligations as well, maybe he should have said without the ""drizzle drizzle"" part."
Lol this is another culture thief attempting to critique what black Americans do because they have no culture no innovation they do have some amount of swagger and that is limited to the accent
"He is a high value man, he should be treated like a king, where have you been? Drizzle drizzle."
"Hell no, if they ask you to go, they pay"
Dude you a simp shut up 😭
Yow bro u don't have a clue Soft guy Era....and u have no clue..
Lol you not getting the joke mon 😅😂

"The Great Tribulation
15“Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand), 16“then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. 18And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. 19But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. 21For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the [c]elect’s sake those days will be shortened.

23“Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There!’ do not believe it. 24For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25See, I have told you beforehand.

26“Therefore if they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the desert!’ do not go out; or ‘Look, He is in the inner rooms!’ do not believe it. 27For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.

The Coming of the Son of Man
29“Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His [d]elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."

The Fall of Babylon the Great
1After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his glory. 2And he cried [a]mightily with a loud voice, saying, “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird! 3For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the [b]abundance of her luxury.”

4And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. 5For her sins [c]have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. 6Render to her just as she rendered [d]to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her. 7In the measure that she glorified herself and lived [e]luxuriously, in the same measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as queen, and am no widow, and will not see sorrow.’ 8Therefore her plagues will come in one day—death and mourning and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who [f]judges her.

The World Mourns Babylon’s Fall
9“The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning, 10standing at a distance for fear of her torment, saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’

11“And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore: 12merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble; 13and cinnamon and incense, fragrant oil and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men. 14The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have [g]gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all. 15The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, 16and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls! 17For in one hour such great riches [h]came to nothing.’ Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance 18and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like this great city?’

19“They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she [i]is made desolate.’

20“Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you [j]holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!”

Finality of Babylon’s Fall
21Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore. 22The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 23The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived. 24And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.”

A Judgment against Babylon 

1The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. 

2Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 

3I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. 

4The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. 

5They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. 

6Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. 

7Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: 

8And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. 

9Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. 

10For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. 

11And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. 

12I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 

13Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. 

14And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. 

15Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. 

16Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. 

17Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. 

18Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. 

19And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 

20It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 

21But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. 

22And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged."

Matthew 18 ►
New King James Version	 Par ▾ 
Who Is the Greatest?
1At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”

2Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, 3and said, “Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. 4Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.

Jesus Warns of Offenses
6“But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7Woe to the world because of [a]offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!

8“If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. 9And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into [b]hell fire.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep
10“Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. 11For[c] the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.

12“What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? 13And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 14Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

Dealing with a Sinning Brother
15“Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. 16But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.’ 17And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.

18“Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

19“Again[d] I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. 20For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.”

The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant
21Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”

22Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. 23Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. 25But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made. 26The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’ 27Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.

28“But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’ 29So his fellow servant fell down [e]at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you [f]all.’ 30And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt. 31So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done. 32Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. 33Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?’ 34And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.

35“So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother [g]his trespasses.”

Jesus Blesses Little Children
13Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.” 15And He laid His hands on them and departed from there.

Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler
16Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good[d] Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?”

17So He said to him, [e]“Why do you call Me good? [f]No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”

18He said to Him, “Which ones?”

Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”

20The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept [g]from my youth. What do I still lack?”

21Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”

22But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

With God All Things Are Possible
23Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

25When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”

26But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

27Then Peter answered and said to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?”

28So Jesus said to them, “Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother [h]or wife or children or [i]lands, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life. 30But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
